ðŸš€ **CnvMP3 Auto Converter**
CnvMP3 Auto Converter simplifies video conversion by automatically detecting supported video links from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels, Reddit, Facebook, Twitch, and X/Twitter. With just one click, it opens CnvMP3, selects the correct platform, pastes the URL, and starts the conversion processâ€”all without manual input.

**Instructions:**
**Installation & Activation:**

Load the extension in Edge via edge://extensions/ in Developer Mode.
Click the extension icon in the toolbar to trigger the conversion process.

**Expected Behavior:**

Clicking the extension button opens CnvMP3 in a new tab.
The extension detects the current tab's URL, selects the appropriate platform, pastes the link, and starts the conversion process.
For TikTok and Instagram: If the link is not a TikTok Video (/video/) or Instagram Reel (/reel/), a prompt appears asking the user to enter a correct URL.

**Platforms Supported:**

YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels, Reddit, Facebook, Twitch, and X/Twitter.
Videos should load correctly on CnvMP3, and users can manually save downloads.

**Known Limitations:**

The extension does not download converted platforms from ALL platforms automatically. For X/Twitter and Facebook, you must manually save the converted file from CnvMP3.
The extension does not handle private or restricted videos.
Edge Permissions Used:

"activeTab" and "tabs" are used to retrieve the current tab's URL.
"scripting" is used to inject content.js to autofill CnvMP3.
"host_permissions": ["https://cnvmp3.com/*"] ensures compatibility with the conversion website.

**How to Verify Functionality:**

Open a supported video link (e.g., a YouTube or TikTok video).
Click the extension button.
Confirm that CnvMP3 opens, the video URL is pasted correctly, MP4/1080p is selected, and the Convert button is clicked automatically.
