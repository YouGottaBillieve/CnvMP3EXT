ðŸš€ CnvMP3 Auto Converter â€“ Privacy Policy
Effective Date: [2/13/25]

1. Introduction
CnvMP3 Auto Converter ("the Extension") automates the video conversion process via CnvMP3. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles user data.

2. Information We Do Not Collect
This Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data, including:

Personal information (name, email, age, etc.)
Financial, health, or authentication details
User communications, location, or browsing history
User activity (mouse movements, keystrokes, etc.)
Website content (text, images, videos, etc.)

3. How the Extension Works
The Extension only activates when the user clicks the button.
It retrieves the current tabâ€™s URL to determine if it is a supported video platform.
If the page is not a valid video, the user is prompted to enter a URL manually.
No background tracking or data storage occurs.

5. Permissions Used
âœ… activeTab â€“ Reads the current tabâ€™s URL only when clicked.
âœ… tabs â€“ Opens CnvMP3 in a new tab for automation.
âœ… scripting â€“ Automates pasting the URL and selecting MP4/1080p.

ðŸš€ These permissions only enhance automationâ€”no data is collected or shared.

5. Third-Party Services

Users should review CnvMP3â€™s privacy policy separately.

6. Data Security
